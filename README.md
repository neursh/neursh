xin chào x3 welcome to my lil public hideout!
me is a fullstack dev since somewhere around 2022 (late covid era), with crippling impostor syndrome, idk.
and also a hobbyist in other fields:
- hardware & embedded systems.
- graphic, motion and shader design.

The thing I hated the most while making stuff with rust is that it will probably never fails at runtime. What do you mean I wrote everything correctly and it works??? Interpreted languages really took a chunk of my soul init.
